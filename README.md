# translate_bot_kotlin

Just a little project where I try out Kotlin. Maybe I'm going to complete the bot maybe not. I'll see

Next steps:
 - Persist chats settings to file (configurable via yml)
 - Build docker. 
     - Figure out how to pass secrets.yml files to docker without exposing
 - Deploy (wohoo)
 - Automate deployment to docker on server (jenkins?)
 - Write tests and setup github actions that run those tests automatically
